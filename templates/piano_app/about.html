        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <p>We are parents, teachers, relatives, and friends who see tremendous opportunities to educate the whole child
        through piano instruction. Today, children, like bees, fly from activity to activity to develop different skills
        and learning strategies. There is often too much to do and not enough time. We support Felicia Feng Zhangâ€™s
        breakthrough method for learning piano notation, music theory, reading skills, math skills, discipline, manners,
        and motor skills in a more effective and efficient way. Moreover, we believe that the well-rounded musician must
        cultivate skills in a community of pianists and experience from the earliest stages of piano instruction the joys
        of sharing in a mutual love of music.</p>
        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>Our mission is to cultivate a rich, deep, and lifelong enjoyment and appreciation of music and the arts from
        a young age; to build confidence, strengthen character, and encourage self-expression through music; to develop
        leadership skills as musicians and in academic pursuits; to engage family members, teachers, and friends as
        crucial supports of music education; and to cultivate core values in the hopes of shaping a more harmonious
        society.</p>
        <h3>Join Us</h3>
